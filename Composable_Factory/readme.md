# Composable Factory

## Overview
Composition is a powerful tool which allows us to build objects that can be **composed** of several different behaviors. It is similar to inheritance in a way, because behaviors and properties from different sources may be incorporated into a single object, but it avoids the need for complex classes and hierarchies. The *Entity/Component* pattern found in Unity is an example of this compositional pattern.

Composable Factory Functions allow us to add whatever specific behaviors or functions we need to an underlying **class** or object without the need for that class to be complicated or cumbersome, or to inherit from a classical structure.
