# React Basics with Router

## Overview
This is a basic example of using React's router to replace DOM elements on a page. This code, although based on the example from *Node.js Design Patterns - Second Edition* uses the new **version 4+ of react-router-don** whose API is a significant departure from that of version 2. For my information, see the [documentation](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) for **react-router**.
